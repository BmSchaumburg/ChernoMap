save chernomap.py and Screenshot.png in the same folder. If you dont have .py files to open with Python natively, then right click chernomap.py and open with python. If you have it set to open with python already, then just double click.

Script is set to download 2 libraries : Matplotlib and Pillow, before running the simulation. 

Comments in the script are fairly self explanatory, even if the description isn't accurate to the value in the script (I got lazy and changed values without updating comments)
